## What you will make
The system on a chip (SoC) of the Raspberry Pi has a temperature sensor that can be used to measure its temperature from the command line. It can provide information on how much heat the chip has generated during operation and also report on the temperature of the environment. This project's aim is to create a simple Python script that can run automatically as you boot up your Raspberry Pi, take measurements from the temperature sensor at given intervals, and write them into log files that can be viewed later. You'll also be able to view the data as an interactively plotted graph.

## What you will learn
By completing the Temperature project you will learn:

- How to run system commands in Python
- How to write data to a file
- How to interactively plot data with matplotlib
- How to set scripts to run automatically using crontab
