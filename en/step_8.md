- If you want to play around some more with matplotlib, you can have a look at the [Visualising Sorting with Python](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/visualising-sorting-with-python/) lessons on the Raspberry Pi website.
- Why not have a look at the [Getting Started with the Twitter API](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-twitter-api/) resource, and have your Raspberry Pi tweet you when the CPU temperature gets too high?
